# Decorators in Python

Decorators are a very powerful and useful tool in Python since it allows programmers to modify the behaviour of function or class. Decorators allow us to wrap another function in order to extend the behaviour of the wrapped function, without permanently modifying it.
 

# First Class Objects

In Python, functions are first class objects that mean that functions in Python can be used or passed as arguments.
Properties of first class functions:
 
 - A function is an instance of the Object type.
 - You can store the function in a variable.
 - You can pass the function as a parameter to another function.
 - You can return the function from a function.
 - You can store them in data structures such as hash tables, lists, â€¦
